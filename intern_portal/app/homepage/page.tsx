              For 10,000 years, the people of the NANA region successfully
              fought for survival in one of the harshest environments on earth.
              When faced with the challenges that modernization, globalization,
              and changes in climate brought, they continued that success,
              forming enterprises that would help them thrive in the modern
              world. The work they do through Akima allows them to prosper in
              both traditional I√±upiat subsistence living and in modern life,
              and to <strong>‚Äúwalk in two worlds with one spirit.‚Äù</strong>
